###Harmonic Mean

Harmonic mean is used to calculate the average of set of numbers. Here numbers of elements will be averaged and divided by the sum of reciprocals of elements. 

The Harmonic mean is always the lowest mean

#### Formula

```
Harmonic Mean = N / (1 / a1 + 1 / a2 + ... + 1 / an)

where 
N: sample size
```

#### Example:

1. find Harmoni Mean of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
	* total number of elemets, N = 5
	* Harmonic Mean = N / (1 / a1 + 1/a2 +... 1 / an)
	
	  = 5 / (1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5)
	  
	  = 5 / (1 + 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.25 + 0.2)
	  
	  = 5 / 2.28
	  
	  = 2.19
