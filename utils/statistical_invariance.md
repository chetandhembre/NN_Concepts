when meaning of object does not change with position/time then it is called statistical invariance.

######example
1. cat detection in images problem, we are not concern with position of cat. So if cat present at top and bottom are still same.
2. In text analysis when meaning of "word" (mostly noun) coming at different part of text does not changes meaning of word.

This is very important feature of convolution neural network as it reduces complexity of network.

In case of object detection/classification problem we can achieve statistical invariance using `weight sharing`.
