######Asymptotically

it means value is so close actual value but never get equal to it. 

asymptotic is a line that approaches a curve but never touches. A curve and a line that get closer but do not intersect are examples of a curve and a line that are asymptotic to each other.

>A simple illustration, when considering a function f(n), is when there is a need to describe its properties as n becomes very large. Thus, if f(n) = n2+3n, the term 3n becomes insignificant compared to n2, when n is very large. The function f(n) is said to be "asymptotically equivalent to n2 as n → ∞", and this is written symbolically as f(n) ~ n2.
