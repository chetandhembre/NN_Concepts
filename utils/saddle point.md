### Saddle Point
***

```
Critical points of a function of two variables are those points at which both partial derivatives of the function are zero.
A critical point of a function of a single variable is either a local maximum, a local minimum, or neither.
With functions of two variables there is a fourth possibility - a saddle point.
```

A point is a saddle point of a function of two variables if

```
 df        df             df''     df''         df''
---- = 0, ---- = 0 and  ------ * ------- - ( --------- ) ^ 2 < 0
 dx        dy             dx       dx         dx * dy
 
 and saddle point.
```

Example
lets consider simple graph as

```
f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2
``` 
this function has saddle point at (0, 0)
