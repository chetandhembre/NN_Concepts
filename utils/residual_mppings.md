####what is residual?

>A residual is generally a quantity left over at the end of a process. 

loosely speaking residual is error. To be precise, suppose we want to find x such that
```
h(x) = b
```

Given an approximation x0 of x, the residual is

```
b - h(x0)
```
whereas the error is

```
x - x0
```
If we do not know x exactly, we cannot compute the error but we can compute the residual.

residual mapping can be new function f(x)(line in space) which satisfy residual (b -h(x0)) for every point
