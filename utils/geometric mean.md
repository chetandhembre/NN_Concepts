###Geometric Mean

The geometric is special type of average where we multiply the numbers together and then take a square root (for two numbers), cube root (for three numbers) etc

####Example
1. What is Geometric Mean of 2 and 18?
	* first multiple them : 2 * 18 = 36
	* then take the square root: sqrt(36) = 6 


2. What is Geometric Mean of 10, 51.2 and 8?
   * first we multiply them: 10 * 51.2 * 8 = 4096
   * then take the cube root: (4096)^1/3 = 16


#### Defination
for `n` numbers: multiply them all togethor and then take the `nth root`

more formally, geometric mean of n numbers a1 to an is

\sqrt{n}{a1 x a2 x a3 x .... an}
